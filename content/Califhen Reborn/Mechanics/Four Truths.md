**Basic Idea:** This Collectible Card Game is based on The Four Truths, an important part of the [[Pantheon overview - White Lodge|White Lodge's]] lore. It is played 1 vs 1, with both sides of the table playing on the same diamond-shaped field. Each corner of the diamond is designated as one of the four truths, and cards to be are positioned and placed on each of them. The cards are rotated in a clockwise fashion until one of the players is left without cards, or yields victory.

**The Cards** all contain abilities and vitality, the latter of which they need at least one of to use their abilities. Each ability activated automatically as long as the card is on a Truth that corresponds with it, at no cost.
**The Abilities** alter the field, alter cards, damage or heal other cards.
**The Truths** - Space, Time, Fate, and Blood - all have their own unique benefit to cards that are on their corner of the diamond. 
A deck is built up of XX cards, and always belongs to a **Faction**. In lore, the creators of the card game have traveled the world to make adaptive decks for major powers. All factions have a unique power that applies to the entire field. There are no restrictions to what cards you wish to include in your deck.
