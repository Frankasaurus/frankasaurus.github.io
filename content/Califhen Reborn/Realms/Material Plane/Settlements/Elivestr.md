The Duchy of **Elivestr** is a port city on the Eastern coast of the Tuon Peninsula, and is the capital city of **Vreebis**. 
# City Description
The city is built on a cliff that runs down the coast, though it has multiple ravines running accross it. The highest and most coastal district is the Citadel, with each next district being lower down the cliff. Elivestr's architecture consists out of wood and red granite, and buildings are often colorful and accented, especially in the wealthier historical districts. It's main exports include books & maps, and mystical creations & teachings.  

Its government is run by intelectuals and guild leaders, who elect a Duke that determines the course of the city. The guilds each run their own Trade accross the entire city region (i.e. the Goldfield Guild runs all agricultural interests).
