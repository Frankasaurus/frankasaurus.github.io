**Elemental Essence Shard** is a Crystal shard currently in use by [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]]. It empowers a Sorcerer by allowing elemental powers to be used in conjunction with metamagic.
# History
The [[Party (C2)]] found this particular shard used as a light fixture by the Dire Troll ruling over the Goblin sewer workers underneath Dragoness Barony
## Appearance
When found, the shard was a dull color, but since Elisabeth attuned with the shard, it shone a pearlescent white. Whenever used, it shifts to an appropriate color for the duration.
# Description
This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

Roll a d4 and consult the Elemental Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

| 1   | **Air.** You can immediately fly up to 60 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | **Earth.** You gain resistance to a damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 4   | **Water.** You create a wave of water that bursts out from you in a 10-foot radius. Each creature of your choice that you can see in that area takes 2d6 cold damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and fall prone. |
