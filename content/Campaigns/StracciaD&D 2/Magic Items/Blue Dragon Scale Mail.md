The **Blue Dragon Scale Mail** is a magical set of armor. It imbues the wearer with a protection specfic to the dragon's hide that was used in creating the armor.
# History
The previous owner was Tergon the Protector, the Half-Dragon herald of Fin Okaaz Hoffkin before perishing for unknown reasons and leaving the armor to rest in the lair in a secret trapped reading room.
# Description
Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of a dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon of the type of armor within 30 miles (50km) of you. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.
