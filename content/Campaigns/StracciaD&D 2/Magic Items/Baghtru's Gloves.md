**Baghtru's Gloves** are the 3rd Relics of Terror on Califhen, and consist out of bracers made out of a rare substance known as stonestring, woven into the wearers hands and wrists. The only known user of them is [[Robyn Heyns]].

# Description
These cursed gauntlets, made of a thin, yet flexible metal and bone plating, are attached to the wearers fist through the stitching of Stringstone, and reflect the purity of terror and destruction of Baghtru.  

## Dormant state
Once per long rest, the wielder can use a bonus action to charge the gloves with up to 5 of their own hit points. On the next strike against a creature, the amount of hit points the gauntlets have been charged with deal twice their amount in Force damage to it. In addition, the wielder gains the Siege effect of being able to deal double damage against objects and structures, even when not charged.  
  
The only way to remove the gloves from the wielder, would be with the Dispel Curse spell, as they are permanently sown into the wielder's hands.

## Resonant state
> [!warning]- Spoiler
> In addition to the features of the Dormant state, whenever Baghtru's Gloves are used to do additional Force damage, it's wielder can choose one of Baghtru's Wraths listed below to do an additional effect;
> 
> - **Aerial Blow:** The attack's target creature must make a Strength Saving throw (DC14). On a failure, the creature is launched 15ft into the air, and will stay there until the start of its next turn. 
> - **Spiritual Assault:** The attack's target creature must make a Wisdom Saving throw (DC14). On a failure, the stonestring unleashes aetherial tendrils that slice the target creature's spirit. Until the end of its next turn, the target creature cannot hide or teleport itself in any way due to its spirit crying in despair, which is audible up to 300ft from the creature. An undead or otherwise spiritless creature is unaffected by the Spiritual Assault. 
> - **Wrathful Spike:** The attack's target creature is launched 15ft. away from the wielder, and becomes prone. Any creatures in the path of the target being launched must make a Dexterity Saving throw (DC14) or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target creature being launched hits an indestrucitible wall or object it can't pass, it takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage itself. The amount of damage can't be changed by other features, including critical hits.
> 
> The amount of hit points the wielder can charge into the gloves also increases to 15.

## Surged state
> [!warning]- Spoiler
> The DC for any saves originating from Baghtru's Wraths is increased to 14 + the wielder's Wisdom modifier.
> The amount of hit points the wielder can charge is increased to 25.
> *More to come...*
