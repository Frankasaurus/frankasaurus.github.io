The **Medallion of Tijani's Hurt** is a magical locket-like construction, which houses the soul or souls of its previous wearer.
## Appearance

# Description
This necklace is a magical key to an Astral Realm, as well as a container for a curious soul. Once per day, the wearer can ask the medallion to reveal something in the wearer's surroundings, though the medallion does not have to answer truthfully.
# Trivia
- Upon first casting 'identify', [[Alex]] was still in the process of figuring out exactly what the medallion was capable of. This has since been corrected outside of the game, and through narrative, though specifics remain vague on purpose.
