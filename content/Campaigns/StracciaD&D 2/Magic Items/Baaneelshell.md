**Baaneelshells** are magical Sea shells that allow the user to breathe under water for a short time.
# History
When Seer Oseath visited Dragoness Barony during the civil war, she wanted to thank the party, and upgraded the Baaneelshells to [[Shell of Saviors]].
## Appearance
When dry, they resemble dull grey common sea shells. But when submerged, the large shell's twists are rainbow colored.
# Description
The shell contains a small bubble of air at all times, enough for a creature to replenish their oxygen supply for 30 seconds when holding their breath underwater.
