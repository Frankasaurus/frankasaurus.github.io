The **Shell of Saviors** is magical Sea shell and an upgraded form of the [[Baaneelshell]], apparated by Seer Dohelyn Oseath as guidance for the [[Party (C2)]]. Each of the members of the party posess one such shell.
# History
In Oseath's own Words of Rite, she wishes to redeem her countless years of worship not for personal gain, but for the good of others, trusting in Olvex' wisdom to assist those that can help the people most in need. Through her, the shells would manifest.
## Appearance
The shells are a dull white, until a being touches or otherwise holds them, which will cause the shell to deform and color corresponding to the person holding them. It is up to the DM to determine the final appearance,  though the shape and color is often determined by a combination of factors, such as actions, faith, personality, goals, and convictions. 
# Description
A creature of high prowess can spend an amount of time the DM finds appropriate to commune with the Shell, during which it will attempt to determine both the creature's deepest desire, and after which the creature rolls 1d6 on the results table. During this time, the creature might be confronted with any combination of flashbacks, halucinations, or visions of the future, which might even test them, though this isn't a requirement.

| Roll 1d6 | Result                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | The Shell digs too deep, and a vapid vision causes the creature to take a point of Exhaustion                             |
| 2-3      | The communion fails, but the creature is able to try again later                                                          |
| 4-6      | The Shell transforms or dissapears, turning into a Magical Object that is suitable for the creature that communed with it |
