**Mana Seal** is a Cursed necklace owned by [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]]. It keeps the wearer from casting any spells.
# History
Though the narrative from [[Kruziik'ahraan]] (who was impersonating [[Xavion de Dragoness]] at the time) goes that this was a timeless piece from her [[Willemijn de Dragoness]]'s collection, this was actually crafted by [[Kruziik'ahraan]] himself shortly after it was known [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]] would soon return.
## Appearance
It resembles a very luxurious piece of jewelry, gold in construction, with multi-faceted diamond embroidered within the precious metal. It has a small set of clasps in the back.
# Description
A magical device that repels mana from those it binds to, making spellcasting near impossible. They typically take the form of a collar, although other types are not any less rare. While difficult to make or find, they are highly sought out by those who wish to keep their slaves from casting spells.

_**Cursed.**_ When the seal is worn or otherwise attached to a creature, it locks in place before extending its curse onto them after 1d4 hours. For as long as the creature is attuned to the _mana seal_, they will not be able to cast spells, or use magical abilities and features (magical weapons and armor function as normal). The seal is impervious to magical effects and damage with the exception of a *Remove Curses* spell, which will detach the seal from its wearer and unattune from them automatically.
