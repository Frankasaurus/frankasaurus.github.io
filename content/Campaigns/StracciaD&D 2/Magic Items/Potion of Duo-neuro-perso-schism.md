# Description
This glass vial is reinforced with silver-stringed lining, and has a slimy substance dancing around in it, seemingly ever-swirling.  
Before ingesting this potion, the person ingesting it must first mix their blood into the vial, otherwise the potion has no effect.When this potion is ingested, the person consuming it will temporarily detach from its material form. All entities reliant on this material form will forcibly reveal themselves through whichever form they want, though they are still bound to the material form. These representations will be extremely weak, and last only moments, before the material balance reverts back to its previous state.  
Though the entities canâ€™t physically or mentally interact with the material word, they can observe and communicate through it. The reverse is also true; nothing can affect these spirits.If the material body of the consumer is unnaturally hindered or affected in any physical way, the entities reliant on the body must each roll a Charisma saving throw (DC18). On a failed save, the entity is detached from the material form and turns into a Specter. If no entities remain attached to the body, it turns into an undead creature appropriate to its power level (weak creatures turn into Zombies, powerful creatures turn into Ghouls for instance). Because the link between body and entity is severed, no spells can revive the original body entity, except for a wish spell.
