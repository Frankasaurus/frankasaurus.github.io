| [[Session C2S32]] | 1 / 10 / 2023  | Arriving in Dragoness Barony, the [[Party (C2)]] is made aware of the state of the Barony. They help the local sick populace a bit, before attending the mandatory mass in the city centre, after which [[Elisabeth de Dragoness\|Elisabeth]] has everyone go to the Palace, meet [[Xavion de Dragoness]], and reorganise and reenergise in the guest house to prepare for a ball.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session C2S33]] | 12 / 11 / 2023 | [[Xavion de Dragoness]] organises an impromptu ball to celebrate the return and power of [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]] and her new allies. The party uses this to get dressed up, mingle with the upper class of Dragoness Barony, but mainly convice [[Charles de Dragoness]] of Xavion's lifelong betreyal by uncovering the contracts of their birth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session C2S34]] | 14 / 01 / 2024 | The ball continues, and a meeting with [[Diederick de Dragoness]] in the maze takes place, who sides with the [[Party (C2)]] as well. Shortly after [[Xavion de Dragoness\|Xavion]] enters the party, the formalities ensue, concluding with a show of force by [[Fumyss]]. The Dragoness Freedom Legion stages a coup shortly before an execution, and the party flees into the sewers with Diederick and Charles.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session C2S35]] | 10 / 03 / 2024 | The party traverses the surprisingly well-kept sewers, as the civil war of Dragoness Barony breaks out above them. They are able to retrieve their gear thanks to [[Charles de Dragoness\|Charles de Dragoness']] loyal guardsmen, and mingle for a while with the "Baggerkoning" - a terrorist-for-hire. Following to sewers to the sea, they are lead to the cistern, where they kill the leaders of the Goblin sewer workers to escape.                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session C2S36]] | 7 / 04 / 2024  | With everyone now able to flee the innards of Dragoness Barony, the [[Party (C2)]] evades being captured by escaping on drakes towards a cave up the coast at the behest of [[Cirdorim]], where they hope to find an item that will help them stop the Civil war's instigators. They find the entrance, but are seen and brought towards the cave's current occupants. In addition, [[Roderick]] reaches a settlement with [[Sargenet]], deciding that they shouldn't need to be allies in order to help each other.                                                                                 |
| [[Session C2S37]] | 20 / 04 / 2024 | The party manages to persuade their captors that their relics are to be traded directly with their leader, which turns out to be a maniacal Morkoth. [[Robyn Heyns]], with the help of her [[Medallion of Tijani's Hurt\|Medallion]], manages to find the relic [[Cirdorim]] was talking about - a [[Dragon Slayer Longsword]]. After defeating their foes, a massive dragon threathens to finish the Party, before revealing that its Cirdorim herself. She finally comes clean with the party and the Lair that used to be her home, and on her back they ride to return to Dragoness Barony. |
