The **Greyskill Refugee Resistance** (GRR) is an organisation and militia consisting of citizens mainly of the citizens of Geros Region's cities, such as in Gabong, but also from Dragoness Barony, specifically in the repressed, isolated, and poverty-stricken Order Quadrant. 
# History
The lack of support from the Northwestern cities to the Southeastern cities when they faced a disastereous refugee and homelessness crisis, resulted in the two regions severing their ties. No real higher authority has stepped up, causing citizens to take matters into their own hands, and establishing the GRR.

They have been established a little under a decade ago due to the rising conflict between the more prosperous Northwestern Elin Prosperity Sphere region of Greyskil, and the less fruitful Geros region in the Southeast. The continent has since been under divided rule, partly due to the Xembadyen Mountain Chain and the Titanic Ridges also physically dividing the continent in two. The citadel of Gabong has become the new capital.
