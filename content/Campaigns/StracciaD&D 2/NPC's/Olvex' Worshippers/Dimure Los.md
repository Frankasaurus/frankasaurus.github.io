**Dimure Los** is a High Elf Holy Warrior of Olvex and his 19th Chosen. As an NPC, she is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
Dimure has a gentle younger smile, but sturdy physique. She has wavy blonde hair that runs past her shoulders and over her pointed ears, and often wears a white garb with golden decorations, topped off with a blue hooded mantle. 
## Personality
A confident character, it is rare to find Dimure in uncomfortable situations, or out of her element. She trusts in her and her patron's powers, but also knows that only she can channel this power. Her responsibility does not weigh on her, as she sees it as not just a calling, but the sole reason for doing. Because of this, she has no hobbies, and rarely rests.
# Biography
Dimure was a dedicated follower from her youth, and rose through the ranks methodically, never pressuring herself to exceed expercations, but simply giving it her best shot each and every time. Her calm collectiveness inspired many chapter of Olvex worship, including the [[Hall of Anew]], but her ferocity was not to be underestimated when it came down to acting as Holy warrior in her patron deity's name. Dimure was very powerful, and bombared dark powers with flame and light, though preferring to keep conflict away from civilization as much as possible, and routing out enemies in their lair to prevent incidents, rather than intervene when necessary.

One of those conflicts was with the Fiend [[Sargenet]], who had been told to expect her by her repsective lord Tareok, making this a proxy fight between the two Greater deities, though on Sargenet's turf. The conflict resulted in none of the two besting the other, though Dimure was slightly worse off. Her final act was to halt Sargenet before her escape, using a permanent Stasis to freeze both their bodies and souls in what is now the Tomb of the 19th Chosen. Their souls later got pulled after much effort by Tareok, resulting in him and Sargenet being in control over Dimure's immaterial being.
## Eliëne
To be used for helping Sargenet in freeing her body, and to punish Dimure for acting against her, Sargenet dominated Dimure's soul and giving her the name 'Eliëne'. As Sargenet had trouble reaching into her pacted soul [[Roderick|Roderick's]] dreams, she instructed Dimure / Eliëne to do so for her, giving her more aggressive tendencies the more Sargenet herself became frustrated with Roderick, to the point where Roderick did not trust Eliëne. Thanks to Roderick's powers causing him to never needing sleep anymore, Dimure lost her worth to Sargenet, and fell out of use for a while.

# Relationships
### Sargenet
Dimure has no unique feelings for [[Sargenet]], and finds her punishment fitting for daring to challenge her; she rather focusses on her own inability to predict Tareok's influence. She sees Sargenet as a pawn, pre-programmed to act the way she does, and not judging her for it. This doesn't make her less of a danger to Califhen.
