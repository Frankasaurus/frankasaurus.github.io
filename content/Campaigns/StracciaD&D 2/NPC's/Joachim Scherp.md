Principale **Joachim Scherp** is the High Elven Principale of Meqen. As an NPC, he is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
With long black hair, slanted eyes, and a slender build, Joachim Scherp is called rather aptly. He is most often dressed in longcoats with flowing blouses, with an ornamental pin signalling his position, and a decorated rapier.
## Personality
Scherp is prone to cut to the chase, and doesn't like the lengthyness some of his aristocratic collegues divulge in. He would rather discuss art or hunting in great detail, and wants politics to be done quickly. Despite this, he is seen as a good politician for Meqen, as he's been doing it for well over two centuries.
# Biography
[[Joachim Scherp]] has dealt with several adventuring parties in his life (including a group from a one-shot), and thus wasn't new to dealing with the [[Party (C2)]]. He quickly arranged meetings with his co-leaders on [[The Featherbelt]], and was also involved in helping the Party escape potential capture after the encounter at [[Benjamin de Dragoness|Benjamin de Dragoness']] temporary housing, even going to jail for it in their place. He held it to [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]] that it would be a debt he would see fulfilled in the future, but considered it a friendly gesture for the time being.
