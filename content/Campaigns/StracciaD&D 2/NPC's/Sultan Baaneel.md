# Biography
The Sultan was growing a small gem mining colony on the sea floor of the Inner Marvers, West of Amala Laguna, using slave labor. He and his Sahuagin militia - led by Baron Lxtrul - kidnapped [[Keylin Ostver]] while she was staying at Cape Rosa. The [[Party (C2)]] persued her on [[Archbishop Ilro'he|Archbishop Ilro'he's]] ship, The Verrewege, with which they tracked the Baron's wherabouts, where they killed him to free Keylin and return her to her father [[Wilmide Ostver|Wilmide]].
