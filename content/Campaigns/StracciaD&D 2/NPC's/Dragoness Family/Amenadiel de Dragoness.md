**Amenadiel de Dragoness** is the firstborn son of [[Xavion de Dragoness]] and successor to Elderdom. More recently, he's the unwilling servant of [[Kruziik'ahraan]]. As an NPC, he is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
Amenadiel is a redish Tiefling with scales covering his hands and neck. His black hair is slicked backwards down to his neck, and held in place with a small circlet. He is of broad stature, and the tallest of all [[Dragoness Family]] members, though not as buff as [[Charles de Dragoness|Charles]].  He often wears a tight silvery-bronze uniform with studded leather, and his weapon of choise is a sabre emblazoned with the Dragoness sigil. 
## Personality
Amenadiel is principal, loyal to the end, and does not question authority whenever he's not it. His sense of honor often overshadows his extreme self-doubt, feeling immense pressure to stand into the shadows of his father. He sees himself as a real leader, not because's he's thinks he himself is good, but because he thinks it is needed. 
# Biography
Months before his sister [[Elisabeth de Dragoness|Elisabeth]] was sent on her quest by [[Kruziik'ahraan]] disguised as [[Xavion de Dragoness]] to recover the secret her father lost, Amenadiel was sent by the real Xavion, as part of the original deal that his father made with the blue Dragon. Amenadiel protested, but accepted his fate, and trusted his father's judgement. Due to the proximity to Kruziik'ahraan, Amenadiel has slowly been magically made subservient of the dragon, and is by now under his control.
