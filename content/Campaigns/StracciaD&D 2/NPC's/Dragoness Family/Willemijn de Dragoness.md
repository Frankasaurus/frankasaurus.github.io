# Description
## Appearance
Willemijn is a Tiefling or grey-redish shade, with fiery eyes and bouncy long greying hair. Her horns grow sideways and back, and she often wears jewelry inbetween them. She is most often seen wearing dresses of modest quality (though never something obscenely expensive), and she is of regular build.
## Personality
Willemijn is very patient and forthcoming, and puts a lot of faith in trust and the experiences she had as a farmgirl in her youth. She knows she is bad a state business or politics, and tends to shy away from any formal duties as much as possible, relegating it to more informed individuals.
# Biography
When [[Xavion de Dragoness|Xavion]] made his deal with [[Kruziik'ahraan]], it was [[Cirdorim]] who wanted to counteract what her older rival had done. Using Willemijn, Cirdorim blessed her children to each possess the ability to defend themselves when their time came, and resist the blue dragon's might, while also keeping in touch with Willemijn for many years. Willemijn kept this secret to herself, only choosing to reveal it to [[Elisabeth de Dragoness|Elisabeth]] and the [[Party (C2)]] when Dragoness Barony was in civil war.

Shortly after Elisabeth's departure, and coinciding with General [[Fumyss]] appointment, Willemijn correctly suspected that something was wrong with Xavion. After voicing her suspicions to the disguised Kruziik'ahraan, he had her put under house arrest within the palace, never to speak of see anybody but him - though Cirdorim came to see her often. To the outside world, Willemijn was to be held in her chambers after becoming hysterical due to the dissapearance of [[Benjamin de Dragoness]].
