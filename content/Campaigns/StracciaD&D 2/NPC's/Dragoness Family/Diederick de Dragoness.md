**Charles de Dragoness** is a Tiefling member of the [[Dragoness Family]], and Scribe to his father [[Xavion de Dragoness]]. As an NPC, he is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
With short, charcoal, wind-swept hair, shorter horns pointed upwards, and a pointed face, Diederick looks as smart has he actually was. Preferring long and light coats in house colors and a pair of round spectacles, he enhanced his otherwise slender build with a flowing outfit. Though he wears a scabbard, it doesn't contain a sword.
## Personality
Diederick knows that he knows a lot, and gets both anxious and cocky about it whenever someone points this out. As the scribe to his father he did most of Dragoness Barony bookkeeping, preferring to isolate himself while doing so. He likes to learn everything about anything. 
# Biography
Through calculations, correlations, and extended thoughts, Diederick concluded himself that something was very wrong, and that he was not aware what it was. When both [[Charles de Dragoness|Charles]] and [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]] discussed their discoveries during the celebrations at Dragoness Barony after Elisabeth's return, Diederick was easily persuaded, but nevertheless felt that he was at risk and had to run. His planned escape route allowed for the [[Party (C2)]] and Charles to flee after the Coup attempt at the Palace Grounds.
