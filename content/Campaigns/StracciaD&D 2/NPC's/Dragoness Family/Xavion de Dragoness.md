**Xavion de Dragoness** is the Baron of Dragoness Barony, and Elder of [[Dragoness Family]]. As an NPC, he is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
Xavion is a regular-sized Tiefling male, with a short salt-and-pepper beard, pronounced cheeckbones, and short to mid-length hair that hide his pointed ears. His horns are sideways before pointing up. He often wears tailcotes, and dresses fancily wherever he goes, always looking ready for state-business.
## Personality
Xavion is determined to have Dragoness Barony succeed, but is bad at admitting fault when it comes to it. Moreso when he was young, Xavion was obsessed with what became after death, and what people will remember you for, leading to his choices in founding Dragoness Barony, and cutting a deal with [[Kruziik'ahraan]].
# Biography
While raised as a farmhand, Xavion saw growth as the driving force behind progression and good, sparking an interest in growing as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The result will always justify the means. This meant that when [[Willemijn de Dragoness|Willemijn]] was expecting of their first child [[Amenadiel de Dragoness|Amenadiel]], Xavion saw his chance in offering his children's lives in exchange for riches and fame for founding Dragoness Barony.

When the time came to fulfil the contract, Amenadiel did not spark any resistance from Xavion, but this changed with the reluctant and wise [[Benjamin de Dragoness|Benjamin]], leading to a deterioration of the relationship between Xavion and Kruziik'ahraan, which in turn led to the dragon not trusting Xavion anymore. Kruziik'ahraan chose to abduct Xavion and impersonate him, to bend Dragoness Barony to his will, and add it to his riches in lieu of potential servants. Xavion was then kidnapped and brought to Scar's Rest, but not controlled like Amenadiel or Benjamin.
