# Description
## Appearance
Charles is often described as 'handsome', helped by his strong physique and build, with S-curved horns oddorning his head, and short black hair swept to one side. He carries himself proudly, and has a broad smile that - when honest - somewhat counteracts his characteristic handesomeness. He has brone scales running over his face and shoulders. When not wearing formal ceremonial attire as Captain of the Palace Guard, Charles is often seen wearing close to the same identical equipment as the rest of the Palace Guard, and is rarely seen without.
## Personality
Charles is of sound mind, often second- or third-guessing, and doesn't take anything at face value. He values honesty and rightiousness, but at the same time appreciates duty, and has difficulties deciding what to do when these clash with each other. He also is prone to pretending to more interested than he actually is.
# Biography
Shortly after his sister [[Elisabeth de Dragoness|Elisabeth]] was sent to find [[Benjamin de Dragoness|Benjamin]], Charles was put in charge of the Palace Guard by orders of [[Xavion de Dragoness]], who was at this point [[Kruziik'ahraan]] in disguise. Charles was never told of [[Xavion de Dragoness|Xavion's]] deal with [[Kruziik'ahraan]], and was only convinced after [[Phillipa Vurrinir]] was able to show him his double-sided birth certificate hidden in Xavion's study during the celebrations of Elisabeth's return.
