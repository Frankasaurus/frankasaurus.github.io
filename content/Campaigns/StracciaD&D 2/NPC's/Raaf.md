**Raaf** is an Imp who used to be in service of the Yagnoloth in charge of Cirdorim's Lair. As an NPC, she is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
An imp can assume animal form at will, but in its natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned humanoid with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings. Raaf in particular has an inky black palm pressed on his chest, as a mark to Tareok.

Raaf is able to shapeshift into other small animals, taking the form of a Raven whenever needed.
## Personality
Raaf is a dim-witted by sympathetic being, always wanting to help any individual he finds. It was her own suggestion to help Sargenet, after other Baatezu refused to assist their old collegue and competition. 
# Biography
Raaf was sent by Tareok from the Nine Hells to the Material Plane in order to find and assist [[Sargenet]] in helping his spirit reach his body. During this travel, Raaf got swept up in Astral Winds, and was blown off-course. She was then found and captured by Kobolds, and brought to Cirdorim's Lair as a priced posession. With the [[Party (C2)]] finding him trapped in the lair, their goals overlapped just enough to have the friendly Raaf decide to join them considering his odds of survival would increase greatly.
