# Biography
Jules Charr was born on a farm in the Elemental Plane of Fire as a strong farmer's son, who after traveling to Greyskil with [[Doreen Charr]] was one of the people involved with building the city walls of Dragoness Barony, and threw a big stink when they didn't get paid. Though they were housed within the city (unlinke others), Jules and several others joined the emerging Dragoness Freedom Legion.

For his actions, he eventualy was prosecuted and sentenced to the dungeons, but not before sending his wife and two children off towards the trading ships from the Bloeming Isles. He died in captivity, and became a martyr to the cause. Nearly 30 years later, he is still remembered as the founding member and main face of the resistance.
# Relationships
### Doreen Charr
His then-girlfriend, later wife, [[Doreen Charr]] and Jules were interested in exploring the Material Plane of Califhen after generations of both their families never travelled. After their journey, landing in Greyskil essentially meant they only had each other, and they grew very fond of each other. Both were driven and thoughtful individuals, and very sympathetic. So when the call to build a city to house and defend many people was spread through Greyskil, both jumped into action. 

To the end Jules prioritised his relationship with Doreen over everything else, even as high-ranking individual in the resistance. 
### Ingrid Solt
When Olvex still had active worshippers in Dragoness Barony [[Ingrid Solt]] was the chapter leader, and due to his prominence in the resistance, he kept close ties with both Ingrid and other spiritual leader. Tough they often clashed, he trusted her with his life, resulting in Jules Sr. trusting Ingrid with bringing a todler [[Sabine Charr]] and baby [[Carmine Charr]] to safety in the Bloeming Isles before his family's persecution.
