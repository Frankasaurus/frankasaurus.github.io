# Description
## Appearance
Ilro'he is an adult-looking elf with dark skin and black hair, though her age only shows through her personality. Her neutral pearl-white attire stands out even among her peers, and is deliberately unadorned with any religious symbolism. She always carries a massive tome and large scepter wherever she goes, which are used in casting spells and recording important notes.
## Personality
Ilro'he's personality is built on neutrality, and serves only the greater good. She enjoys and is good at her position of mediator, recording conversations and desires from all involved parties, and constructing an outcome that everyone can agree with. She also knows that this is not always possible, and that a conflict of interest can descend into physical conflict very rapidly. Thus she remains aware and prepared wherever she goes, and is tough both on the outside, as well as on the inside. It is not publicly known whether she has other interests besides her job, but due to frequent traveling she has become quite world-wise, and is known to enjoy nature and architecture.
# Biography
Ilro'he has been Archbishop for the Bloeming Isles for nearly a century, a position she earned due to her toughness in handling conflicts, and standing relations with both established religions of the common folks, and local tribes that have been present on the isles for ages. Her task is to harbor peace amongst the different people of the Bloeming Isles and surrounding area - not just religions. She also frequently consults the many Principale's and leaders in maintaining their settlements. She is often seen as 'the voice of the people', and is well regarded with most common folks and established religions, though less so by the aristocracy.
