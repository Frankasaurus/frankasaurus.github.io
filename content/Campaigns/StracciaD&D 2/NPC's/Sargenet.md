**Sargenet** is an Erinyes Pact-Devil whose soul currently roams with [[Roderick]], as her body is trapped in the Tomb of the 19th Chosen. As an NPC, she is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
Sargenet is tall, slender, and could be mistaken for a celestial in her beauty. Though she can shapeshift, in her natural form she has red sideways horns and pale skin, with sleek red-accented black armor. Whatever form she takes, she has black feathers and glowing red eyes.

Whenever her soul takes shape or posesses another human, she prefers the opposite of her actual appearance, in an older cloaked bearded male. Whenever her roaming soul is not inhabiting an individual, it looks like a Wraith.
## Personality
Sargenet swings between confident and rash, especially now that she's in stasis and dependant on Roderick for influencing the world around her, as she had once just done herself. She grows frustrated by reckless positivity and lazyness. While not reveling in causing suffering itself, Sargenet is loyal to her duties and takes pleasure in pleasing her Lord Tareok by granting contracts to mortals. 
# Biography
Sargenet was a Baatezu acting at the behest of her Lord Tareok in closing pacts and gathering souls for her lord, which drew the attention of The 19th Chosen of Olvex, [[Dimure Los]]. After Dimure tracked Sargenet to her hideout in the Xembadyen Mountain Chain in central Greyskil, the ensuing battle did not result in a decisive winner, with both being severely weakened and on their last legs. Dimure's sacrifice at the end of the battle, resulted in both of them going into stasis, with their bodies locked in the hideout. 

After nearly 130 years, Sargenet's Soul - and that of Dimure - wormed her way out of Stasis thanks to her Lord, though weakened and lacking a material body. Being tossed into the Material Realm and randomly dropping in the The Wovens of Orphelica gave her limited options with limited time and limited bodies. After some failed attempts, [[Roderick]] unknowingly ended up settling to a proper Devil's pact, which gave her time and energy - and influence - to recover energy according to Roderick's actions. Together with her Lord she corrupted Dimure's soul to become [[Dimure Los#Eliëne|Eliëne]] - a puppet of Sargenet to influence Roderick.

After embedding and retrieving Roderick's Soul Stone, she recovered in power, though Califhen's Holy Law requires her to be worshipped in order to break the Stasis Seal. This resulted in questions, then commands, then threaths to Roderick to supply worship to her, but after Roderick defeated her Wraith form and stopped sleeping, Sargenet was defeated for a while, and bided her time before attempting a parley.

# Relationships
### Roderick
[[Roderick]] was an emergency choice for the very weakened and lost soul of Sargenet, after being banished for over a hundred years. Sargenet very much regrets her pact, seeing that Roderick is both unwilling, bold, and unmoving in listening to her commands, though she does have some control over the powers he uses. Not used to the less influential form she is now relegated to, she is not used to not being able to solve her problems herself quite as easily now that she relies on her pact.
### Dimure Los
Especially before meeting [[Dimure Los]], Sargenet saw nothing in the distant powers of Greater Deities that mortals relegated themselves to, evident by the many who came to her to escape their miserable lives. While this gradualy changed over time due to conflict with rival Holy Orders, Sargenet eventually acknowledged some respect for Dimure and her power, especially after the battle. Dimure's sober stance to her own patron Olvex was also refreshing, though nevertheless foolish in Sargenet's eyes. She is thankful for Dimure for giving her perspective, though she is still unfetteringly loyal to Tareok and the other Banished Gods, seeing no future, power, or glory in the other Orders.
