**Sabine Charr** is a Fire Genasi Bounty Huntress and the sister of [[Carmine Charr]]. As an NPC, she is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
Sabine is a Fire Genasi and looks a lot like her brother, having similar red skin and orange hair, with a slight flicker of flame in her eyes. She is a little shorter than Carmine. She is rarely seen not wearing practical clothing befitting of a bounty hunter, with high boots, a wide-brimmed had, and a long coat with dozens of clasps and pockets. In addition she carries a sizable pack for outdoor survival.

Sabine uses at least two guns. The first is a slightly smaller one, holstered on her left hip, which can be fired one-handed. The other is a two-handed single-shot rifle for long-range use, often carried over her shoulder or strapped to her back.
## Personality
While not blunt, Sabine doesn't keep things subtle when she can avoid it, preferring to have all cards on the table as soon as possible (evident on her first encounter with the [[Party (C2)]]). While sympathising with her targets on one hand, she has mentioned that the job has made her close off some of those emotional ties, as the job comes first. A job that she does mainly because she is good at it.
# Biography
Sabine mentioned knowing she and her brother were born in Dragoness Barony shortly after construction completed of the city walls. For reasons she did not know at the time, they were handed to [[Ingrid Solt]] while boarding a ship to Cape Rosa during a city-wide incident. No further recollection of this time is known, but Sabine does remember not enjoying her stay at the [[Hall of Anew]]. After fleeing multiple times, the church eventually let her go willingly, resulting in Sabine having to take care of herself. Several oddjobs down the line, she landed a job as Bounty Huntress, which she appeared to be quite good at and continues to do to this day, currently working for a client in Ayhwen Town - from whom she was granted her unique firearms.

A regular retrieval job to return [[Benjamin de Dragoness]] to her client, resulted in an unexpected reunion with her brother [[Carmine Charr]], recognizing him as "Jules" - a name Carmine wasn't familiar with at that point. The recognition of her brother changed her perspective on the job somewhat, and she traveled with the [[Party (C2)]] on Tezeder for a while, looking for Benjamin and surviving dangerous encounters in the meantime. 
After Benjamin got abducted by [[Kruziik'ahraan]], Sabine - together with nearly everyone else - got blasted by his Lightning Breath, and dropped unconcious. Being revived by her brother, and regaining her breath for a while, Sabine admitted to not knowing what to do or think for the past several years, but that the encounter has returned that conciousness. She returned with the party to [[The Bonehead]], and jumped ship shortly after arriving in the port of Telack, citing that she herself also has a bounty on her head.
# Relationships
### Carmine Charr
[[Carmine Charr|Carmine]] in particular did not trust Sabine for a long time during their time on Tezeder, not completely incorrect. Though she promised to assist in the party's seach for [[Benjamin de Dragoness]], she wanted to see how things played out, as there still was a job she had to do for her client. In the end she did not interfere with Benjamin's encounter at Tezeder's Peak.

Her brother is younger, but she recognizes him as the wiser. Where she was not able to adjust to Cape Rosa and the life of worship, she sees that Carmine has harnassed its powers very well, though she does not completely understand it.
