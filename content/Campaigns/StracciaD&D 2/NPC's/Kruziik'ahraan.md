# Description
## Appearance
As a gigantic Blue Dragon, Kruziik'ahraan is adorned from top to bottom with dark blue scales. The only exceptions are his tan-colored belly, his gray horns, and his pinkish wings.

When taking the form of a human, a slender, bald bearded figure is most often used, with a fitting sleeveless blue robe used as attire. His skin is toned like dark sand.
## Personality
Kruziik'ahraan sees a purpose in growing his collection as a means of power projection. His collection includes material treasures like relics, magic items, and a small gold hoard, but also includes people, buildings, inventions, and projections of power. His crowning jewel is Dragoness Barony, seeing it has his own city filled with his own people, serving him and only him. This included the magically gifted [[Dragoness Family]], with the powerful younger siblings being mended to serve Kruziik'ahraan as powerful slaves after the age on their birth contract is reached. 
# Biography
Kruziik'ahraan has roamed Greyskil for over 5 centuries, choosing to mostly grow his horde in the southern region. Serving no god, but allowing his inner biological desires to steer him, he craved to grow a powerful horde for many centuries, and sees it as an important part of courting other dragons for offspring, of which he has many. He has made the Courtyard of Deities his home, calling it Scar's Rest. Using the gorges, ravines, cliffs, and caverns to hide himself whenever threathened, he has made it his domain, with the open and desolate area being an excellent trap for outsiders, and an even better cell of prisoners. 

Several decades ago, he grew tired of material gains, as he had most of them already. With Southern Greyskil becoming poorer, it was also harder to find good loot. It was then that he took inspiration from Devil practices, seeking to add power to his hoard. In a human form, a [[Xavion de Dragoness|desperate soul]] was sought, and deal was forged. Within several decades, Dragoness Barony would grow to become a renowned and powerful city, thanks to many of his own cash injections. With is hoard dwindeling, and the deal coming full-circle, he now seeks his return on investment.
