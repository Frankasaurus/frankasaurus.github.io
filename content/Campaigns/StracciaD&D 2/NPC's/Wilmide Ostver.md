# Description
## Appearance
Wilmide is a SIlver Dragonborn of regular physique, often seen wearing regal but modest garbs in accordance to the occassion.
# Biography
Wilmide was the initial employer of [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]] when she left Dragoness Barony and thus the first employer of the entire [[Party (C2)]]. With Telack under threath of a foreign pirate gang, Wilmide had to remain in the city, while his daughter [[Keylin Ostver]] attended the anual Bloeming Isles leadership meeting, to be chaperoned by Elisabeth and the others.

After Keylin's kidnapping, Wilmide had been informed by [[Joachim Scherp]] that Meqen had found and sheltered [[Benjamin de Dragoness]], who at that point became the focal point of the Party's quest. He granted them his old holiday ship - now named [[The Bonehead]] - as additional reward, figuring he had no need for it now that the city needed his attention the most.  
# Relationships
### Xavion de Dragoness
As both Wilimde and [[Xavion de Dragoness]] attend meetings surrounding important Bloeming Isles topics, they have met as professionals, and occassionally as friends, though that is years ago by now. Wilmide watches Xavion's Dynasty carefuly, to learn from both its successes and its mistakes.
# Trivia
