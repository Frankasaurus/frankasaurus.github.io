**Keylin Ostver** is an orange Dragonborn living in Telack as the daughter and heir of [[Wilmide Ostver]]. As an NPC, he is played by [[Alex]].
# Description
## Appearance
Keylin is a small orange Dragonborn with large eyes and a permanent smile. She is most often clothed in decorated dresses, with bead jewelry she made herself. She has a small pouch she caries with her that acts as a Bag of Holding.
## Personality
Being very shy, Keylin is not known to publicly expres herself confidently. Whenever she does, however, she is a playful unconcerned ball of energy.

When she was held captive by [[Sultan Baaneel]], she trusted that the [[Party (C2)]] would rescue her eventualy, and kept the promise to her father to stay strong when confronted with danger. Especially [[Elisabeth de Dragoness]] forged a good bond with her, and Keylin was quick to trust her the most.
# Biography
As her father [[Wilmide Ostver]] couldn't go to an important meeting in Cape Rosa while dealing with dissent in his own City, Wilmide requested [[Xavion de Dragoness]] if his daughter, [[Elisabeth de Dragoness|Elisabeth]] would be able to guide his daughter to the meeting. Xavion sent Elisabeth, and together with her newly acquinted friends, she formed a [[Party (C2)]] with which Keylin would travel. After sailing to Cape Rosa aboard [[The Giant of Jaxos]], she was kidnapped by Baron Lxtrul under the orders of [[Sultan Baaneel]], two days before the meeting. The party followed their trail to his hideout to defeat the Sultan and free Keylin, in which they succeeded. With Keylin freed and returned to the capital, they finished up business and returned to Wilmide. Keylin herself admitted that it would be enough adventure for at least the next couple of days.
# Character information
Keylin is a low-level Sorcerer, inheriting sorcery from an unknown origin as neither her mother nor [[Wilmide Ostver|Wilmide]] are known to be Sorcerers.
# Trivia
- [[Alex]] notes put Keylin down as WIlmide's son, but this was changed during her introduction due to Alex misremembering.
