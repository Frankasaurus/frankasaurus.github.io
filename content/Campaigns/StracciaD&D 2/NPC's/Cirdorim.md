# Description
## Appearance

Besides her Bronze Dragon appearance, she most often takes the human form of an older unassuming gentle woman, or a squirel of rich orange color. When in this form, she wears dull orange clothing, and has greying auburn hair.
As a Bronze dragon, Cirdorim has many smaller horns pointed backwards and fanning away from her stump and sloped snout. Her bronze scales are accented with slight green tints, like oxidized copper, though her chest and belly is covered in thicker, marble-colored plates. Though not as gargantuan as the Ancient counterparts, the is of large stature, and has a wingspan of over 70ft.

## Personality
Cirdorim is a typical lawful Bronze dragon, though more careful than most. She takes her place on Califhen seriously, and is very considerate with her actions, especially when [[Kruziik'ahraan]] is known to be near. She believes that her actions should spark other actions. Through inspiration, healing, guidance, wisdom, and training, she hopes to prevent conflict, rather than partake in solving it. That being said, she is no pacifist, and supports the [[Greyskil Refugee Resistance]] as an ally, though not a member, in the hopes of bringing to light the troubles of Greyskill's neglected Southeastern regions.
# Character information
As an adult Bronze dragon, Cirdorim has the ability to use Lightning Breath, fly, and shapeshift. 

Before spending years in Dragoness Barony to help out the populace in fighting disease and oppression, she made her lair in Fin Okaaz Hoffkin, which used to be a Dragon outpost in previous era's. While this was mainly in order to protect the [[Dragon Slayer Longsword]] and [[Blue Dragon Scale Mail]] hidden in the lair, Cirdorim took a liking to watching ships, especially the ones nearly as big as her.
