**Robyn** is a Half-Orc Monk of the Way of the Astral Self. She is played by [[Lise]].
# Description
## Appearance
Robin is a muscular, relatively slender half-orc woman. Due to her heritage, her lower canines protrude from her mouth, and her skin is greenish grey in tone. She has black braids and dreadlocks for hair, with colored accents wrapped around some of the dreads. Thanks to becoming infused with [[Baghtru's Gloves]], her fingers and hands have stonestring woven through them; hair-thin flexible wires that solidify when used with aggressive force. 

Thanks to her years in the circus, she wears colorful but practical clothing, mainly consisting out of loose striped pants, foot-wraps, and a short sleeveless top.
Her neck and wrists are adorned with a smattering of custom-made jewelry, mostly consisting out of rope, leather, wood, shells, pearls, stones, and even teeth. Though not worn anymore, she used to have [[Medallion of Tijani's Hurt|Tijani's Medalion]] worn around her neck as well, before she snapped the cord.

# Biography
## Before the campaign
> TODO: [[Lise]] wants to re-write this. Text is still available below, but subject to change.

> [!info]-
> Robyn was born in a coastal village on the continent of Uurogh, far to the north of Califen, where various orc tribes are constantly in conflict with each other. The village is called Torpe. It consists of around ten to fifteen round stone huts in the sand, adorned with yellow and green flags and cloths. Robyn can still remember her birthplace, though she has more or less forgotten the people with exception to her close friends and family. Robyn's parents worked hard; her mother [[Rhayn]] was a herbalist, and her father [[Linzo]] a simple goat herder since losing his leg in battle some years ago. As a child, Robyn played a lot with her friends Ruzo and Thex. They often engaged in role-playing games or put on theatrical performances. Robyn loved dancing; she choreographed small shows for all the parents in the village. She was imaginative and creative. Life in Torpe progressed slowly and simply.
> 
> When Uurogh introduced mandatory conscription below age 25 as a way of bolstering the ranks, the life of Robyn was changed. Kasegrimm was at war with Burduur and urgently needed manpower, both at the front lines and at the base. Robyn was taken away from her home at the age of eleven for forced labor. This involved tasks like cleaning and cooking. Robyn worked long days, ate cold leftovers, and slept in a hammock with barely any shelter over her head. Fortunately, Robyn was not alone. She had Ruzo, Thex, and thirteen other kids with whom she shared sleeping quarters with. They had no personal possessions such as toys; their entertainment consisted of singing, dancing, and sharing stories. This kept an element of childhood and a love for life alive.
> 
> After four long years of service to Kasegrimm, Robyn, Ruzo, and Thex finally managed to escape with the help of Tohangh, a half-orc two years older who had become friends with them. Tohangh had been forced to serve for a longer time as punishment for thievery, and desperately wanted both himself and as many of his peers out. Fleeing through the mountains, they survived for three weeks and arrived in Simplefeld, tired and starving. While the band of refugees did not speak a word of common, the village - mainly inhabited by halflings and humans - understood exactly what had happened to them. Robyn was kindly received and taken care of here. They were given a warm meal and a place to stay at Mrs. Thierze's inn.
> 
> On the third day of her stay in Simplefeld, a group of entertainers happened to arrive in the village, called [[Mozelin Brown's Bazaar]]. Madame [[Mozelin Brown]] - an eccentric dwarf with a deep bass singing voice - was the founder and proprietor of the circus. Robyn felt drawn to this group, auditioned with her dancing, and got a job with the circus. Ruzo also had enough talent, and Thex was allowed to join as a guard provided he learned to fight well. Tohangh bid farewell to the three, as he would find work elsewhere. The circus set off towards the Bloeming Isles, stopping in every village along the way to perform. Robyn and Ruzo performed as a duo, known as "Rob en Ruzo." The stage felt like home to Robyn. She was given a horse and a tent and quickly integrated into the group. Robyn got along well with almost everyone, except for [[Macaw]] and Evie. Macaw was a renowned minstrel, adored by the audience. Robyn found him arrogant and full of himself. He treated her as if she was nobody. Evie was a clueless follower of Macaw.
> 
> Life as a gypsy was dangerous; the circus was frequently attacked. Robyn had to learn to defend herself. As a half-orc, Robyn was naturally robust and relatively strong, providing a good foundation for combat. With her tusks, even as a 15-year-old girl, she appeared intimidating to enemies. She learned to fight with her hands and feet and developed a martial fighting style as an extension of her dancing.
> 
> Robyn also received training from the mysterious Loxodon named [[Tijani]]. He turned out to be a master Monk from the Yaeghara Monastery in the east. He was skilled in the way of the Astral Self and deeply connected to his Ki. Why he left the monastery remains unknown to Robyn; Tijani didn't talk much. Master Tijani was looking for an apprentice and sought the traveling circus for protection in return. He had unique talents that entertained people. Tijani taught Robyn the power of meditation, an area she had less aptitude for compared to fighting. Robyn wasn't particularly calm. She preferred partying and drinking over meditation, but she was still amazed by Master Tijani's abilities and decided to give the "zen" lifestyle a chance. Tijani explained to Robyn that meditation was the path to her inner power or Ki, and the goal was to find and channel this energy. At the age of seventeen, Robyn finally managed to use her Ki in battles and could now rightfully call herself a monk. By then, Robyn had come to view Master Tijani as a kind of father figure. She wanted to make him proud and took his example to heart, although she was also just a rebellious teenager who wanted to do her own thing.
> 
> After a performance in Cape Rosa, Master Tijani suddenly gets hit with a dart in his neck. Robyn is right behind him and witnesses the event. Though she gives chase to a dark figure ducking into the bushes, she fails in following the figure. When she returns, Tijani is lying on the ground with Madame Mozillin and Macaw attending to him. From a distance, she notices that Tijani has noticed her return. He looks at her and simultaneously presses something into Macaw's hand. Robyn can't hear what he says. Before she can reach him, Tijani passes away. His body, his belongings, and the dart all vanish into nothingness, like an illusion.
> 
> Robyn knows that a simple dart couldn't have meant the end for this monk, even if it were poisoned. Robyn knows that monks are immune to diseases and poisons. She's too bewildered to process the death of her master. So many questions race through her mind: Who was the black figure? What kind of enchanted dart felled Tijani? What did Tijani say in his final moments, and what did he give to Macaw? She dares not ask the latter, but she can't sleep due to curiosity.
> 
> One night, a week after Tijani's death, while the group is getting drunk in an inn in Cape Rosa, Robyn sneaks into Macaw's room and rummages through his belongings. In his bag, she finds the [[Medallion of Tijani's Hurt|amulet]] that Tijani always wore around his neck. Without hesitation, she pockets it. "Macaw should never have had this," she thinks. "Tijani meant it for me." The next morning, Macaw realizes that the amulet is missing and suspects Robyn due to her sneaky behavior over the past week. When he goes to confront her, he sees that her belongings are gone. Through the window, he sees Robyn running away from the inn. He chases after her. Robyn escapes him by leaping onto a ship that is about to dock. Macaw isn't nearly as agile as Robyn and gives up. Robyn looks down at him and shouts a few choice words. As she turns around, the ship's crew glares at her angrily. How is she going to explain this...

## Quests
Robyn main focus is finding out what happened to Tijani, and who killed him. The amulet also hides away secrets that Robyn doesn't fully understand yet. Who was the black figure? What kind of enchanted dart felled Tijani?

Her question of what his final words were, and what he gave to [[Macaw]], were answered during a run-in with Macaw himself in Cape Rosa According to the bard, he was to give [[Medallion of Tijani's Hurt|the medallion]] to her "when she is ready". Tijani said Robyn would be ready in time, and that Mozelin should let her persue her path as a monk. By stealing the medallion, Macaw feals as if his judgement to decide when Robyn would be able to answer the mystery of Tijani's assassination was robbed.
