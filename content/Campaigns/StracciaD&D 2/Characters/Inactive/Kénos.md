# Biography
## Before the campaign
Kénos was created in Larchenia by a greedy temple leader, who crafted Kenos under the noses of two other leaders, hoping it would become a mighty creation aligning with his deceptive and deceitful personality. Unfortunately, the experiment failed, and Kénos was abandoned and neglected, even though she was built with an experimental anti-gravity type of precious metal called Dusfex. One infiltrator knew differently, a sage, who associated with Kénos within the temple, teaching her about the world and Teokharis.

Kénos embarked on the path of adventurers in search of an identity; she wants to live a life, not remain a machine, and seeks a way to become human. She only claims to be on a crusade, as it sounds less conspicuous. Her journey has taken her from the East to the West of Drav-Modesta, then onward to the Western continents. Upon arriving in Telack, she continued her journey with a troupe of [[Party (C2)|strangers]].

## Quests
Kénos developed a common 'issue' among warforged, namely that of identity (or the lack thereof). No longer serving her original purpose, she is in search of one, and where here powers can be used for the better.
