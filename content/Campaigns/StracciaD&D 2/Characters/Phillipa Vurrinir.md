# Biography
## Before the campaign
Phillipa is a descendant from a wealthy family, growing up in a relatively safe, predetermined environment, where she didn't feel home. When she was still young, she started picking pockets of the cleaners and waiters serving the house and its guests, as a an act of defiance towards her parents. After one too many altercations, she fled into the wide world, though without the financial support of her parents, she resorted to her trained stealing skills in order to make it in the city. 

After a few years, Phillipa had ventured quite far into the criminal underground, allowing her to travel further and further from the financial safety net of her parents, whom she hadn't seen in years by now. This resulted in a tour of the Bloeming Isles, finally ending up in Meqen. After establishing herself there and getting to know fixer and showboat 'Henkie', she caught a lead on a double-whammy; a job that would both hinder a cult of questionable morals, and pay well from the rewards looted from their corpses. For several days, she pursued this lead further, leading her to spring a trap on [[The Seven Scepters]]. When finally prepared to confront the Cult, a random [[Party (C2)|band of adventurers]] got caught while trying to sneak up on them as well, and battle ensued. In the aftermath of battle, her position got compromised, but Phillipa sought to strike a deal; in return for helping the adventurers get some cheap goods, she would be allowed to venture with them for a while.
