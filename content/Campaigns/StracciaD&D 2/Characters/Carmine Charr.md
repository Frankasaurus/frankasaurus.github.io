# Description
## Appearance
Carmine is a red-skinned, orange-haired humanoid, like most fire Genasi. His hair is kept short at the sides, but swept back up top. His eyes are typically fire-y red, nearly glowing when looked at in the dark. He is of average height and build.

His clothes are a mixture of green and brown, with the white-and-blue [[Cloak of Olvex|Cloak of Olvex]] adorning his back. His spellcasting focus - and amulet of Olvex - is prominently hung from his neck. He also uses a regular shield on occasion.

## Personality
Carmine tends to approach things thoughtfully, and likes to be aware of his situation. He often draws responsibility unto himself, and takes that responsibility seriously, like when he was a Carpenter on the [[The Bonehead]]. Beyond this, Carmine's wants to see the world, which is reflected on his desire to spread the word of Olvex through travels.
Despite this, he's also known to enjoy the simpler things in life. Carmine laughs often, and is an avid fisher.
# Biography
## Before the campaign
Carmine grew up without ever knowing his parents. His first memories are of growing up in the [[Hall of Anew]], a temple dedicated to Olvex, located at Cape Rosa. Carmine's youth mainly consisted of studying old scrolls in the library of the settlement. Despite Carmine looking quite different from the average Olvex follower, he was not treated differently. He grew up with two other children of roughly the same age, namely Silver Prist, a human girl, and Duder Clont, a halfling boy. At an early age of 11, after a quarrel with his friends, Carmine angrily ran away. He had had arguments with his friends before, but this time it felt different for Carmine. He didn't necessarily feel anger, but more of an outburst. At that moment, Carmine noticed that his hands were emitting heat. Initially, Carmine was startled by this, but soon he saw it as a sign of recognition from Olvex. Over the years, Carmine received several such gifts from this new patron.

Until he turned 25, Carmine was a proper follower of this Olvex, the God of Creation. Around his 25th year, however, Carmine began to doubt whether his current life aligned with his vision. Carmine wanted to honor Olvex by spreading his word and making a new beginning for himself. However, it was a dilemma that took Carmine a long time to decide upon. It wasn't until well after his 27th year that Carmine was sure â€“ he wanted to leave this life behind and celebrate Olvex in the open air outside Cape Rosa. In the middle of the night, Carmine packed his only belongings, such as the amulet and emblem of Olvex, and set off south of Jaxos Isles.

Between his 27th and 28th years, Carmine traveled southward, took on a number of adventurous tasks to earn some gold, and also spread the word of Olvex. Something was always missing for Carmine; he felt alone during his journey. On his 28th year, Carmine arrived in Telack. With few gold coins in his pocket, Carmine is searching for a job to earn some extra money.

## Quests
Carmine's passive goal is to always spread the word and honor Olvex, though his methods are rather subtle at times, especially with the newly found focus on his adventuring party.

More prominently, Carmine has discovered he is (on the way to becoming) the 20th Chosen of Olvex, after several centuries of there not being a (known) Chosen. He has discovered the implications of this thanks to rescuing the petrified remains of the [[Lord-Master Ligune]] - the 18th Chosen of Olvex - at the sunken Towers of Stendor. His current task is recovering the identity and remains of the [[Dimure Los|19th Chosen of Olvex]], as a means of discovering what unfinished business he is meant to continue.
