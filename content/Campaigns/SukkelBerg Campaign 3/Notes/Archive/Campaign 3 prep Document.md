# Perpetual goals of campaign 3
Here I've listed the pillars of - what I think - makes a D&D campaign, combined with the issues that I had with each of them, and how I want to counteract these issues.
## Pillar 1: Narrative
Issues with last campaign: 
- Narrative arcs were **drawn out**
- Arcs included **filler segments** that didnt add to the story
- Some players felt both **excluded** or **too much** in the spotlight, others **left out**
- Arcs were made with a **specific player** in mind, and not the party, excluding members
- Lacking **tension** and **hook** for most players
- A bit too **generic** in both feel and actions

Goals for this campaign's narrative:
- Present fresh arc's that speak to (a large portion of) the party as a whole
- Cycle through arcs relatively quickly and focussed, at least in the beginning
- Allow players to drive the narrative a LOT more
	- Present open-ended options that do not have an end-scene in mind
	- Allow for moments that do not have fixed solutions
## Pillar 2: Characters
Issues with last campaign: 
- Characters were created with a **short campaign** in mind
- The creation was very open-ended, **without much guidance** from DM
- Backstories were **individualy** created
- Characters weren't **incorporated** into the story
- Nobody was given a clear overarching goal
- A lack of individual **rewards**

Goals for this campaign's characters:
- Add restrictions.
	- Funnel everybodies backstory into 1 similar situation
	- No more across-the-map backstories. You **must** start as a nobody
- Think with the players during creation, especially for long-term progression
- Encourage creating a story together, as we are with a big group
- More **items** and other customizability options
## Pillar 3: World
Issues with last campaign: 
- **Premade** without much wiggle room; **inflexible** to the campaign
- **No** player input in the worldbuilding
- Way overdone and **overpresented**, with a lot of irrelevancies
- Within the campaign, **unvarried**
- Lacked **mysteries**, ended up being very **one-tonal**

Goals for this campaign's world:
- Build the world **around** the story. Invent locations **on demand**, rather than in preparation
- Implement player's **backstories** in locations.
- Each location must be **destinctively flavored**
- The surrounding elements - pantheon, realms - must be of **quality** rather than quantity
	- Add **variety** through story rather than numbers
# Game pillar toolbox
Here I've listed the three pillars of the *game* of D&D as described by many a game designer, and what I think I could use to make these fun and engaging. 
**Variety** is the all-encompassing term here.
## Combat (red)
- Varied and interactable maps
- Remember the varying outcomes besides ultimate death: capture, fleeing / surrender, 'second phase', 
	- Combine these with another element for a dynamic story beat, like fleeing foes luring you to their trap.
## Challenge (yellow)

# Focus for the first sessions
- Session 1-2:
	- [ ] Intro players to each other and their location
	- [ ] Intro mentor figure
	- [ ] Strong start to first short arc, escaping the prison island
		- Idea: allow for options like a boat, a temple with an ancient portal, or a flying / swimming creature.
## Concepts:
1. Mentor is 'M' Leeflin, founder of Leeflin Bruut, who has planned a coup of the island with all the other prisoners. She escapes and uses the party in the process. Upon completing the attempt, she will honestly declare that she is going to do heinous deeds on the people who did this to her, giving the party time to escape or join her.
	- This group can then be a recurring theme in the campaign, but that requires it to be relevant enough.
	- Pro's: 
	- Con's: No clear vision on how to segue this into a further plotpoint
3. During a work excursion, the workers get attacked, but the players save the day. If they allow capture by the guard, they become candidates for a fighting ring, or they can escape, or do whatever. 
	- Pro's: 
	- Con's:
4. An external force is attempting a hostile takeover of the area and the prison, and the party is in the midst of the conflict. They can either resist and defend, fight alongside the hostiles, run, or do whatever.
	- Pro's:
	- Con's:
