# Factsheet
- **What Guild were their parents a part of?**
	- Halfclock Guild of Arcana. Their parents were lawmakers to the government, and filed reports and proposals to the ruling bodies.
- **What caused the hunt and death of their parents?**
	- [[Kaurius Krone]], backed by several houses and unions, led a revolt against multiple guilds, stripping them of their power and 'exposing' their corruption, which oftentimes was forged evidence. During the revolt, also called "Night of the Long Moon" (due to the calm sea casting a bright and long reflection of the moon, seen as its 'judgement'), the Halfclock guild was besieged, and their parents caught in the crossfire.
	- Part of Kaurius' reasoning was their refusal to acknowledge 'the Old Ones' of the White Lodge (a collective name for long-existing gods, including Olmari), by arguing that by ignoring half the pantheon, they are ignoring half the city's population. When Kaurius tried to force the Guilds to acknowledge the Old Ones, the guilds ignored his request as the White Lodge in general was of no political concern.
	- To this day, the Night of the Long Moon is a divise topic throughout [[Elivestr]].
- **How does the rest of the party impact his backstory?**
	- D
