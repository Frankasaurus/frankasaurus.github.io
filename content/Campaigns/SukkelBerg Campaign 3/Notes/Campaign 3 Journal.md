# First arc setup
The first arc is going to be ~4 Sessions long, and revolve around the party's escape from Cogastr and return to mainland. They will have to...
- Deal with the prison break
- Decide on what destination they want
- Cross the sea, or deal with the ancient temple on the island for a teleporter, or find a way to reach external assistance
- Get back on their feet and re-obtain their items

The hook is going to be either...
- Facing the Leeflin Brut folks chasing them 
- Taking over the island's occupants

# Surrounding Area in a nutshell;
**[[Celiria]]** is often divided into North- and South-Celiria. Cogastr is a very small island in North-Celiria, within the Naryn Sea, stradling the Eastern coastline of the Tuon peninsula.
- **[[Cogastr]]** is an island nation that has been ruled over by criminal dynasties, and trades its plentiful resources for workers and cash, plus luxuries around the world.
	- Between it and the Tuon peninsula, the bay that flows from the Naryn Sea is called the **Cohyn Sea**.

The main nations of the Tuon Peninsula's East coast are as follows;
- **Vreebis** is historically the oldest, being run by a monarchy that has ran for hundreds of years. Their unique factor of success is their education and mystical prowess, but also their large population. Its capital is [[Elivestr]]. 
- **Gisat** is a royal offshoot that has embraced its temperate weather, and are industrialists fast catching up to their neighbors. Its capital is Rysanter.
- **Calndoorn** has mastered transportational technology to conquer the plains within its borders. It prides itself on self-sufficiency. Its capital is Bocastr.
Note that not every settlement within a nation answers to their ruler, and might have exemptions or otherwise be self-sufficient enough to not need or want a ruler.

Throughout the Tuon peninsula, many smaller nations exist, such as the mostly underground **Fyndon** and **Treadon** citadels, the **Yuv'nil** Fae council within the large forests, and the Ancient city of Tagrib high in the mountains. 
In general, the East coast of the Tuon peninsula is better developed due to better climate.
# First arc setup
Currently looking like the party will have a LOT of connections to [[Kaurius Krone]], so Id have to work out everyone's relationship with him first.  Here's what I know from the players;
- [[Lenora]] has a heavy connection; her father was/is his rival. He is (thought to) be the main cause of her affliction.
- [[Yerall]] and [[Nyrin]] both have strong connections; their exile from Elivestr is due in part to his actions against their parents.
- [[Herman]] has a weak tie; former prominent citizen turned enemy of the state, now under the thumb of the guilds.
- (No ties for Gallus & Garrick, but perhaps we can score one)
In general, we can consider the following beats, disregarding nuance or sidetracking for a moment;
1. After reaching shore, getting equipment
2. Moving to Elivestr Region
3. Reacquianting with the surroundings - keep tension high and the players on their feet, there'll be time to relax later
4. Meeting Kaurius, followed by a setback - let's do a short meeting prior as well, get eyes on ASAP
5. Preparing for a confrontation
6. Confrontation & climax
7. Release & TWIST - Kaurius wasn't the head honcho after all. They've helped the city, but evil still roams

Before any later steps can happen, it'd be smart to do the following first;
- Individual character notes for developments - fill in their blank spaces. Important: make the party a requirement!
- Think about a future arc that ties into the existing story (perhaps concerning Leeflin Brut?)
- Work on Gallus & Garrick especially, to not make them feel left out
