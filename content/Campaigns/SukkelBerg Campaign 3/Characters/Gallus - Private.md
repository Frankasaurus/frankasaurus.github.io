# Biography
## Before the campaign
Born in Circinus, a Druidic Circle of Stars, Gallus was raised with the conviction that the constellations held the future. Growing up, he'd be taught about the lessons stars can tell you, and how to foresee the future. In fact - being able to do so would tell one they were on the right path. At the coast, far away from civilizations and cities, where the stars were most visible, is where Gallus and the Circle had their home; Aurora. 

But this conviction, like the moon, waned with time. As he grew older, Gallus became disillusioned with the Circle's main beliefs, and stopped trusting that the stars could show you the future, instead only showing lessons from what happened in the past. This fundamental shift in conviction gained traction among his piers, resulting in a small but rebelious countermovement, which was ultimately disbanded by the Circle's Archdruid, Carina Majir.

The disbandment came with banishments for those who opposed Circinus' core principles, and Gallus was ceremoniously banished as a result too. For two years, Gallus had to integrate himself with the wider world, learn its practices, and struggle to earn a keep. Part of this introduction into society, was getting to know [[Garrick]], a traveling street performer with a Cat companion. Together, they would make a living by combining their skills to do magic tricks.

This went well for a while, but a catastrophic performance in Hanpr led to mass hysteria of the crowd, and their subsequent arrest. Whether by fate, a lack of luck, or overexeggaration, the pair were sent off to [[Cogastr]] as trade for minerals Hanpr needed. It was here where a spontanious trip to the isolation cells resulted in the meeting of talented individuals. After a daring escape of the island, they would form [[Party (C3)|an adventuring party]].
