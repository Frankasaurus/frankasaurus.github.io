# Biography
## Before the campaign
Herman used to be a prominent figure in the city of [[Elivestr]]. He acquired a lot of wealth, and got things done for himself and others, earning the nickname 'Silvertongue' due to his frequent swindling. Besides wealth, Herman had a loving wife and daughter whom he raised in the wealthy rings of the inner city.

When his daughter became older, she also became more rebelious. Not just against her father, but against the swindling and lobbying of politics and "high-class" citizens. In her disdain and sabotaging of the large Houses and Guilds of the city, she made herself an enemy that Herman couldn't defend her from. She and her mother were murdered, leaving Herman alone with grief and the sour taste of his daughter's dissapointment. Within this, he found the opportunity to better himself, using his Silver tongue one last time to remove him from further justice, and 'only' bannish him from the city.

After leaving the city, Herman used his remaining wealth to build out a farm, its purpose to house difficult kids and give them a second chance, besides shipping the produce to the city. These kids often came from violent and unstable backgrounds, and caused a lot of trouble - to the extent that Herman had to step in several times. On one such occassion, a fleeing kid from his farm would be framed for a murder he didn't commit (along with [[Yerall]] and [[Nyrin]]). Herman took the blame, and was sent out to [[Cogastr]] for this crime. Here, he got a chance meeting with several unique and powerful individuals. Upon their escape, they would form [[Party (C3)|an adventuring party]].
