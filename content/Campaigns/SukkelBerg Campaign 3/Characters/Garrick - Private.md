# Biography
## Before the campaign
Growing up in the small town of Rhomea to the south of the Pentos Woods, Garrick and his family got everything they needed from the forest surrounding them. With particular affinity to animals, his desire for adventure led him into the woods often, though none would obey his commands easily as a cat he chanced upon. One that would follow him around in his travels to see the world. It listened carefully, could to tricks, and earned Garrick a tidy profit to eat and sleep from while on the road. 

A night at a tavern like every other turned into a happy encounter with a Druid from further away, [[Gallus]]. Their companionship sparked ideas for earning a bit of money to sustain themselfs, and they would do tricks in neighboring towns and villages, their magnum opusbeing a switcharoo; Garrick's cat would wander out of sight, and Gallus, wildshaped as a panther, would emerge. Though this earned steady cash several times, their performance in the city of Hanpr caused mass hysteria on the street. This, combined with unpaid dues to government officials for street performances, put them in jail.

Whether it was fate or just exaggeration from the warden, Garrick and Gallus would be sent off to [[Cogastr]] to work for minerals the city needed for their fabrication trading. When they were unceremoniously put into isolation cells, they met other unfortunate but talented individuals. Upon their escape, they formed [[Party (C3)|an adventuring party]].
