# Biography
## Before the campaign
Lenora was born in the political family of Von Elsenburgh-Doorne, her father [[Wilmar von Elsenburgh Doorne|Wilmar]] being the guild leader of the Justice & Security guild in [[Elivestr]]. Wealthy and secure, she grew up to be an intelligent and popular member of society, and ends up studying at Elivestr's Prestiguous College of Law. She had a wealthy family in a large estate, two older sisters and two black Dobermans called Poppy and Pebble.

As a liberal member of the city's Corporatocracy, Wilmar's rivalry with the ruthless [[Kaurius Krone]] caused not just himself a lot of confrontations with those seeking to undermine the city; At the height of political turmoil, this opposition turned to Lenora as well. In an attempt to blackmail her father, Kaurius kidnapped Lenora, and banished her to a realm of shadows. Instead of being intimidated, Wilmar did not back down and exposed Kaurius' actions to the public, demanding he return his daughter. When Wilmar received the soulless body of his daughter, Kaurius demanded he drop out of the race for Duke in order to restore her soul. 

During her time in the shadowy realm, Lenora's soul became infused with it, and drained much of her energy. From that point onward, she began to feel empty, like a husk. After a short, unknown duration, she spontaniously returned to her own body in her father's embrace, though he felt a lot colder than before. Wilmar becomes quiet, retreated, refuses to talk and stops attending his meetings. Through her worries and questions, combined with the strange new powers the realm of shadows and another unknown origin has given her, Lenora becomes motivated to take action.

In her motivation, she found herself plotting to murder Kaurius, the person who has ruined her and her family, and intends on bringing the entire city down. Mere weeks into her plotting however, a combination of becoming ever weaker and feeling more and more empty, caused her to be caught in the act. Thought Kaurius personally signed her death sentence, for unknown reasons she was sent to [[Cogastr]] instead, where she happened upon a chance meeting with unique and powerful individuals. Upon their escape, they formed [[Party (C3)|an adventuring party]].
