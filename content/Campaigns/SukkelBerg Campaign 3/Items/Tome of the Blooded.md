After it was lost, it was passed between Fey creatures, ending up with the a Boggle collector. This Boggle was captured by smugglers, hidden in a chest, and then abbandoned for 50 years. When the [[Party (C3)]] arrived with refugees from [[Cogastr]], they discovered the chest and release the Boggle. The book was chosen as a reward, concealed by a riddle, and given to Lenora.
