**Tome of the Blooded** is a magical book, currently in possession by [[Lenora]].
# Description
This large tome has a red leatherbound cover, with red infernal markings addorning the face of the book. A large Silver alloy clasp is afixed to the book along the opening side, with no physical way to open it. It perpetually drips blood. If you attempt to clean the book through any means, physical or magical, the blood will re-emerge seeping from the cover and pages.

The clasp is magically applied to only be opened with a Knock or Wish Spell, unless one can find the author of the book, in which case the clasp will unbuckle upon the command "I want to read the Tome of the Blooded" read in Infernal. 

Upon it's release, the book will burst open violently, with the trembling and ever-bleeding shrivelled hand of the author casting spells right away. Until the hand has all it's rings & bracelet removed, it is invulnerable to any damage and will continue to cast spells.
# History
The book was created to seal in the hand of Andries Stellard. Andries collected magical rings from long-dead arcanists, and bore 5 of them simoultaniously to see what it would do. At that moment, the clashing of old arcane powers caused his body to erupt in pain, resulting in Andries cutting off his hand to quell the pain, after which he sealed it in his book with research on the ring. In this process, the book transformed to a tome of Infernal power, writing down all it knows during it many centuries locked up within.

The rings on the hand are the following;
- Adurel's Ring
- Pivostoli's Ring
- Gae'lridhid's Ring
- Fedor's Ring
- Stellard's Ring
- Telinde's Bracelet

After it was lost, it was passed between Fey creatures, ending up with the a Boggle collector. This Boggle was captured by smugglers, hidden in a chest, and then abbandoned for 50 years. When the [[Party (C3)]] arrived with refugees from [[Cogastr]], they discovered the chest and release the Boggle. The book was chosen as a reward, concealed by a riddle, and given to Lenora.
